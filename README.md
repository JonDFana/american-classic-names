# Popular names in North America
Have you ever wondered what trends parents follow when naming their kids? What are the most populars? or even how popular is your own name? With the data extracted directly from the Social Security database we can give them an answer easily, which is my proposal with engaging narrated EDA and an appealing dashboard.

This is one of my projects from Datacamp where I took the liberty to add, remove and improve some orginal aspects of it not to make it look so basic.
