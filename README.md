# Popular names in North America
Have you ever wondered what trends parents follow when naming their kids? What are the most populars? or even how popular is your own name? With insights drawn directly from the Social Security database, I propose providing clear answers through engaging narrative exploratory data analysis (EDA) and an appealing dashboard interface.

This project, derived from DataCamp, has been enhanced with modifications to outstand its original counterpart. While the dataset may be modest in attributes, the true mark of a skilled data analyst lies in crafting compelling narratives and storytelling to unveil insights. It is my endeavor to deliver an engaging reading experience, and I trust you will find it enjoyable. For further details, please refer to <b>names.ipynb<b/> file where a SQL-based report is provided with further insight into the data.
